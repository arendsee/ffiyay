Learning how to import foreign functions. I will start with simple C functions.
Then move on to Java to explore the more complex interface with objects and the
possibiliy of object permanence between calls. Is it possible to preserve our
expensive objects?

After figuring out simple cases, I will move on to writing a binding to a much
more complex library, Apache's `Jena` Java library for semantic programming.

For now I am focusing on using external libraries, not exporting Haskell code.
Though I will need to branch out eventually.
